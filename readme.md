## Number Sequences

Build a function that takes following number sequence `1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32` and computes the next number in the sequence.

Stretch: Build a function that takes an arbitrary number sequence and tries to find the next number in the sequence.


## Fibonacci and Prime

Build a function that takes in a number and then lists Fibonacci numbers up to that number.

Stretch: build a function that takes a number and then determines if that number is prime.

## Loops and Accumulator

Redo all of the exercises from Friday.

logAll([1,2,3,4,5]);
// => 1 2 3 4 5
```

```sum([1,2,3]);
// => 6
```

```subtract([10,10,10]);
// => -30
```

```largest([1,9,7]);
// => 9
```

```smallest([20,19,40]);
// => 19
```

```average([10,20,30]);
// => 20
